- People living without rhythms tend to be disorientated and anxious
- Reflex is a special signal that creates a specific action
- Reduced dopamine production is compensated in the brain by increased production of adrenaline.
- Stress comes from the inside, the cure is to find a starting point for your project.
- You will have to pay interest for the service of spending more than you can afford right now.
- Constantly choosing all the time between all possible alternatives creates anxiety and disturbs out focus.
- Being able to do something because you have decided to do it is the foundation of good time management.
- If your stress system is never neutralized by mental recreation, you'll notice a number of symptoms.
- Never spend five minutes extra on an activity when the clock rings. If I did, it would slow me down for the next Pomodoro.
- You can't see the big picture and focus on details at the same time
- If I have many unplanned activities, it implies that I miss a lot when I plan in the morning.
- Estimation and measurement are two essential parts of the Pomodoro Technique
